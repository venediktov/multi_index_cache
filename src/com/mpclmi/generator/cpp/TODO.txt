This directory contains a set of classes that should be able 
to process annotated by developers classes and produce hirearchy of 
Cache->Container->indexes 

1. do some research on reflective visitor pattern or see if generic visitor pattern is enough , 
possibly some kind of delegator pattern needed instead of visitor , this has to be yet decided.

2. Need some kind of abstruction , that will decouple the actual code generator from the output format.

3. But for the first release OK to merge both processing and code generating functionalities in each of
 Cache.java , Container.java , Index.java
